Chapter 3 - Epidemiological Data
--------------------------------
Enhanced former subjection "2.2 Epidemiological Data" as requested by the primary reviewer and promoted it to be a section on its own.

Fig. 3
------
* Reviewer 2 noted that "In Figure 3 left there are 4 body size groups but on the right and in  the small image above the arrow there are only 3 groups." This is due to the the mapping on gender, the size-group 139-153.5 cm is only populated by women, while 182.5-197 contains only men.

Background
----------
* Simpsons Paradox. Reviewer 2 pointed out a possible relation between confounders and Simpsons Paradox. The Reviewer is right, since Simpsons Paradox is a very extreme case of a confounder (http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6967/1480).

Implementation
--------------
* Due to the lack of space we did not expand the `Implementation` section. Also Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 1 made contrary statements about whether the section should be extended or shortened.

Evaluation
----------
* We conducted an evaluation with two domain experts. Due to the high degree of expertise needed to understand the data as well as the epidemiological background it was not possible to consult more specialists-but since both of these experts play major roles in the entire study as well decide, which features and image modalities are included in future acquisition cycles, their feedback is very valuable!

Minor
-----

* Replaced "and colleagues" with "et al". where appropriate and moved citations closer to the names (for example "Dai and colleagues explored risk factors ... [10]" changes to "Dai et al. [10] explored risk factors ..."
* Removed implementation as 1st class contribution in the introduction.
* Moved parts of the Introduction after the contribution list as suggested
* Dropped citation of Tufte2003 "The cognitive style of powerpoint: pitching out corrupts within cheshire" for statement "Correlation does not automatically imply causation."
