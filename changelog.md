Chapter 3 - Epidemiological Data
--------------------------------
Enhanced former subjection "2.2 Epidemiological Data" as requested by the primary reviewer and promoted it to be a section on its own.

Fig. 3
------
* Reviewer 2 noted that "In Figure 3 left there are 4 body size groups but on the right and in  the small image above the arrow there are only 3 groups." This is due to the the mapping on gender, the size-group 139-153.5 cm is only populated by women, while 182.5-197 contains only men.

Background
----------
* Simpsons Paradox. Reviewer 2 pointed out a possible relation between confounders and Simpsons Paradox. The Reviewer is right, since Simpsons Paradox is a very extreme case of a confounder (http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6967/1480).

Implementation
--------------
* Due to the lack of space we did not expand the `Implementation` section. Also Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 1 made contrary statements about whether the section should be extended or shortened.

Minor
-----

* Replaced "and colleagues" with "et al". where appropriate and moved citations closer to the names (for example "Dai and colleagues explored risk factors ... [10]" changes to "Dai et al. [10] explored risk factors ..."
* Removed implementation as 1st class contribution in the introduction.
* Moved parts of the Introduction after the contribution list as suggested
* Dropped citation of Tufte2003 "The cognitive style of powerpoint: pitching out corrupts within cheshire" for statement "Correlation does not automatically imply causation."
