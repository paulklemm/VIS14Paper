%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1
%% typefaces, ``graphicx'' for inclusion of EPS figures. and ``times''
%% for proper handling of the times font family.

\usepackage{times}

%% We encourage the use of mathptmx for consistent usage of times font
%% throughout the proceedings. However, if you encounter conflicts

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{Epidemiological population studies impose information about a set of subjects (a \emph{cohort}) to characterize disease specific risk factors.
%
Cohort studies comprise heterogenous data variables describing the medical condition as well as demographic and lifestyle factors of a subject.
%
Using well established statistical methods the data is hypothesis driven analyzed to find statistically significant variable correlations ('\emph{interactions}').
%
Modern cohort studies also incorporate medical image data.
%
Analyzing these data requires image segmentation, extraction of key figures and shape based subject grouping.
\\
We propose a Interactive Visual Analytics approach that enables epidemiologists to examine both image-based as well as sociodemographic and medical attribute data.
%We propose a Interactive Visual Analytics approach to provide epidemiologists with the tools necessary to analyze this data.
%
It allows for both classical hypothesis validation approaches as well as hypothesis generation by incorporating data mining methods.
%
Adaptive linked information visualization views and 3d-shape renderings are combined with epidemiological techniques.
%
Similarity measures between data variables are used to compute interesting changes in variable interactions for the current variable selection.
%
Shape based grouping of subjects is facilitated using hierarchical agglomerative clustering.
